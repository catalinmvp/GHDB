Android app

Hello everyone and welcome to our gaming community, we are GHDB. 

Our project is developed 100% in Java for android. 

WHY JAVA?

Android App are mostly developed in JAVA language using Android SDK (Software Development Kit). Other languages like C, C++, Scala etc. can also be used for developing Android App, but JAVA is most preferred and mostly used programming language for Android App Development. So if you are a beginner in Android then JAVA language and complete knowleadge of OOPS concepts is the first thing you need to learn before beginning Android Development.


WHY ANDROID STUDIO?

Android Studio is the official integrated development environment (IDE) for Android application development. It is based on the IntelliJ IDEA, a Java integrated development environment for software, and incorporates its code editing and developer tools.

To support application development within the Android operating system, Android Studio uses a Gradle-based build system, emulator, code templates, and Github integration. Every project in Android Studio has one or more modalities with source code and resource files. These modalities include Android app modules, Library modules, and Google App Engine modules.

Android Studio uses an Instant Push feature to push code and resource changes to a running application. A code editor assists the developer with writing code and offering code completion, refraction, and analysis. Applications built in Android Studio are then compiled into the APK format for submission to the Google Play Store.
